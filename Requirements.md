# Requirements

## MVP

- when the user starts the game, a timer is set in action
- the game consists of submitting **HTML** element names using the keyboard
- the game tracks the progress of the current session in the form of a percentage (no. of correct submissions / total no. of HTML elements)
- the game stops if
  - the user chooses to forfeit the current session
  - the time runs out
  - or all the **HTML** elements have been submitted

## Nice to have

- the user should be able to select between 3 levels of difficulty that differ between them by the amount of time available
  - novice
  - intermediate
  - grandmaster
- the current session progress percentage is broken down into three categories: **experimental**, **deprecated**, **standard**
- the game should signal to the user how much time is left through a background color
  - 100% - 50% green
  - 50% - 25% orange
  - 25% - 0% red
